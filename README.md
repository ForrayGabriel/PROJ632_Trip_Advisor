# PROJ632_Trip_Advisor

The goal of this data science project is to give our program the url of a restaurant on trip advisor, get the user names and the reviews of every one that posted for this restaurant, then retreive all the reviews on other establishment from these users.
The data could then be used to try to identify fake reviews.

The program use beautifulsoup to scrap information from the websites.

It is composed of three python files.

To use it, launch main.py and enter the url of the restaurant on trip advisor. The output will be a file name with the name of th restaurant.

restaurant_finder.py is used to get all the user names that reviewed the restaurant, and user_com_fincer.py retreive all the other reviews from these users.

The three txt files included are exemples of what our program can do.
